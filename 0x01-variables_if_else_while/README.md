## 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while

#### [0. Positive anything is better than negative nothing](0-positive_or_negative.c)

This program generates a random number and assigns it to a variable 'n'. The program then checks whether the value in 'n' is positive, negative, or zero and prints the result accordingly.

#### [1. The last digit](1-last_digit.c)

This program generates a random number, assigns it to the variable 'n', and displays the last digit of 'n'. It then checks if the last digit is greater than 5, is 0, or less than 6 and not 0, and prints the result.

#### [2. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game](2-print_alphabet.c)

This program is a simple application written in C that prints the alphabet in lowercase using the putchar function. Upon running the program, it will display the letters a through z in succession, followed by a newline character. The main function serves as the entry point for the program and always returns a value of 0.

#### [3. alphABET](3-print_alphabets.c)

This program is designed to print the entire alphabet in both lowercase and uppercase letters using the putchar function. Once the program is executed, the output will appear in the console.

#### [4. When I was having that alphabet soup, I never thought that it would pay off](4-print_alphabt.c)

This program is designed to print the alphabet in lowercase (excluding the letters 'q' and 'e') using the putchar function.

#### [5. Numbers](5-print_numbers.c)

This program is designed to print all single digit numbers of base 10 (starting from 0) using the putchar function.

#### [6. Numberz](6-print_numberz.c)

This program is designed to print all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line. It uses a for loop to iterate through each number and the putchar function to print it to the console. The program has a main function that returns 0 upon completion.


#### [7. Smile in the mirror](7-print_tebahpla.c)

This program is designed to print the lowercase alphabet in reverse order, followed by a new line. It uses a for loop to iterate through each letter, starting from 'z' and ending at 'a'. The putchar function is then used to print each letter to the console. The program has a main function that returns 0 upon completion.

#### [8. Hexadecimal](8-print_base16.c)

This program is designed to print all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line. It uses two for loops to iterate through each digit of the numerical system. The first for loop prints the numbers 0-9 in base 16. The second for loop then prints the letters a-f in base 16. The putchar function is used to print each digit or letter to the console. The program has a main function that returns 0 upon completion.

#### [9. Patience, persistence and perspiration make an unbeatable combination for success](9-print_comb.c)

This program is designed to print all possible combinations of single-digit numbers, separated by commas and spaces, in ascending order. It uses a for loop to iterate through each number from 0 to 9. The putchar function is then used to print each number to the console. If the current number is not 9, then commas and spaces are also printed to the console to separate the numbers. The program has a main function that returns 0 upon completion.

#### [10. Inventing is a combination of brains and materials. The more brains you use, the less material you need](100-print_comb3.c)

This program prints all possible 2-digit combinations of unique digits (0-9) in ascending order, separated by commas and spaces. 

#### [11. The success combination in business is: Do what you do better... and: do more of what you do...](101-print_comb4.c)

This program prints all possible combinations of three digits in ascending order, separated by a comma and a space. The digits range from 0 to 9. However, it only prints combinations where the first digit is less than the second digit, and the second digit is less than the third digit. It stops printing combinations when the first digit is 7.

#### [12. Software is eating the World](102-print_comb5.c)

This program prints all possible combinations of 2-digit numbers.
