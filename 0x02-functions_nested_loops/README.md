This is a project that focuses on practicing C programming language concepts such as nested loops, header files, and variable scope. The project contains several C files, each of which contains a function or program that performs a specific task.

The following is a summary of the C functions and programs in the project:
.
1-alphabet.c: A C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
2-print_alphabet_x10.c: A C function that prints the alphabet in lowercase 10 times, followed by a new line.
3-islower.c: A C function that checks for lowercase characters. Returns 1 if the character is lowercase, 0 otherwise.
4-isalpha.c: A C function that checks for alphabetic characters. Returns 1 if the character is a letter, 0 otherwise.
5-sign.c: A C function that prints the sign of a number. Returns 1 and prints + if the number is greater than zero, 0 and prints 0 if the number is zero, and -1 and prints - if the number is less than zero.
6-abs.c: A C function that returns the absolute value of an integer.
7-print_last_digit.c: A C function that prints the last digit of a number. Returns the value of the last digit.
8-24_hours.c: A C function that prints every minute of the day of Jack Bauer, starting from 00:00 to 23:59.
9-times_table.c: A C function that prints the 9 times table, starting with 0.
10-add.c: A C function that returns the addition of two integers.
11-print_to_98.c: A C function that prints all natural numbers from an input to 98 followed by a new line. The numbers are separated by a comma followed by a space, and they are printed in order. The input represents the number to begin counting from, and 98 is the last number printed.
